So this is a document parser for expense tables. You might be thinking "Most banks will let you download records directly to your computer as a csv. Why do you need this???" Well some banks have not heard of csv files and just give you a webpage and say "good luck". So, I wrote a parser in python. Copy the content of the page to the program input and my parser will give you a csv you can put in excel. This readme also doubles as a test file!

Disclaimer: This program parses text to write a table to spreadsheet. It is not intended to replace a more secure program, or safe practice for handling personal information. Do not run your banking records through random programs you find online.

I encourage you to run my program on the contents of this text file as a test. 
Please run the test and take note of the License before parsing your sensitive information.
Also, please be sure to back up important files before running programs on them.  
This is the result you should expect after the test (without the X on each line):

Oh yeah so despite being online this thing still comes with pagination so you can print it or something. Remember 2005? Remember Mapquest? We have not updated this part of the site since then!
The webpage is pretty noisy too. It includes a lot of text that is not a record of your card activity. Stuff like:
