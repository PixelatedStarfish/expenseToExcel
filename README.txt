So this is a document parser for expense tables. You might be thinking "Most banks will let you download records directly to your computer as a csv.
Why do you need this???" Well some banks have not heard of csv files and just give you a webpage and say "good luck". 
So, I wrote a parser in python. Copy the content of the page to the program input and my parser will give you a csv you can put in excel. 
This readme also doubles as a test file!

The webpage is pretty noisy too. It includes a lot of text that is not a record of your card activity. Stuff like:

Hey you may be eligible for a promotion from bank!!! Is that awesome?!??!?!? oh yeah!!!

BlahBlah stuff about stuff and card and stuff and a description of a card or something or maybe a disclaimer or who knows right??

Oh 
Wow

Oh yeah so despite being online this thing still comes with pagination so you can print it or something. Remember 2005? Remember Mapquest? We have not updated this part of the site since then!
